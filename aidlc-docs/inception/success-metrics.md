# Success Metrics — Puzzle Pets

## Product success (MVP)
- A 4-year-old can independently:
  - start the app
  - enter a puzzle
  - complete at least one puzzle type with minimal reading
  - receive a reward and see a pet reaction
- An adult can:
  - select harder difficulty
  - complete a session with minimal friction
  - turn on “Zen” visuals or accessibility options
- A grandparent can:
  - read the UI comfortably (large text mode)
  - use touch targets reliably

## Quality success (engineering)
- Works on modern mobile browsers + desktop browsers
- Offline-first:
  - app loads after first visit without network
  - saves persist across refresh/app close
- Performance targets (guiding, not guaranteed at inception):
  - first interactive view within a few seconds on mid-range mobile
  - animations remain smooth (avoid “jank”)

## Ethical success
- No ads
- No real-money loot boxes
- No manipulative retention mechanics (e.g., “pets die if you don’t return”)
